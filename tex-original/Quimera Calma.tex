    Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can add \textbf{1d6} to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to roll the bonus die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.}

        \item If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

    {\textbf{Trigger}: when a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw.

    You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must \textbf{reroll} the d20 and use the \textbf{lower} roll.
    \\[1mm]
    You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has \textbf{advantage} on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this ability at a time.}

The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.

    The vision can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
