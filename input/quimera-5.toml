Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event,
or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast this spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting
after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret."""

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within
1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long
as you have seen such a creature up close – within 30 feet – at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form,
such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.

This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature."""
