The blue crystal of this earring is wrapped with delicate copper wire. The earring has 5 charges.
While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the Message spell.
The earring regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Message spell:** You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only
the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is
beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead,
or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel
freely around corners or through openings.

You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus,
you can use a bonus action to expend one Spiritual Ki and roll on the Spirit Tales table using 1d6 to
determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the
tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to
be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until
you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table
immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.
